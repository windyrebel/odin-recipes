            <p><strong>Ingredients You'll Need</strong>
            </p><ul>
                <li>1/2 cup sliced pepperoni</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
                <li>3/4 cup breadcrumbs</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>Kosher salt</li>
                <li>Cooking spray</li>
                <li>2 large skinles, boneless chicken breasts, each cut into 8 strips</li>

            </ul>
            <p><strong>How to Prepare</strong></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Make the chicken fingers: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Pulse the pepperoni in a food processor until finely chopped. Spoon into a shallow dish
                    and add the Ialian seasoning, breadcrumbs and oliver oil; stir together. Combine the eggs and a pinch of salt in a separate shallow dish and whisk
                    until smooth.</li>
                <li>Put a wire rack on a baking sheet and coat the rack with cooking spray. Dip the chicken in the egg mixture, letting any excess drip off, then coat 
                    with the pepperoni breadcrumbs, pressing firmly so they stick. Place the chicken on the unprepared rack and coat generously with cooking spray. 
                    Bake until cooked through and golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: Combine the marinara sauce and mozzarella in a microwave-safe bowl. Just before serving, microwave, stirring 
                    every 30 seconds, until the sauce is hot and the cheese melts. Serve the chicken fingers.</li>
            </ol>
